11:07am I'm tired 
11:09am Now I understand what to do
2:30pm I am conflicted
4:30pm I have to go to work and teach piano
4:45pm why does this kid have to cry every time something doesn't go his way?
5:00pm I really don't like kids. Why do I work with them?
5:10pm This kid has legit been on this song for two months. Why don't his parents make him practice?
5:30pm The kids are finally going home so I'm smiling and waving like I care.
6:00pm Yay I'm done with work for the day!
6:10pm Gotta go to Sephora because makeup is lyfe
6:13pm I met a cute baby at Sephora with brown skin and blue eyes.
6:15pm I want to marry a black man so I can have beautiful babies too.
6:30pm This lady just gave me a sample of perfume that smells like Caesar's Palace in Vegas.
6:45pm I'm sitting in a parking lot and hoping no one will walk by as I change my clothes. #itscold
7:00pm Time for gymnastics with all my adult women friends!
7:05pm I'm embarrassed by how bad my middle splits are. Look away.
7:10pm I just did a backbend and my whole spine just popped like popcorn.
7:20pm I'm going to try a round-off back hand spring!
7:21pm I don't think I was supposed to land on my knees.
7:30pm 7 backhandsprings later and I finally landed on my feet #progress
7:35pm "If you like running at stationary objects, vault's for you!"
7:40pm I am now running at a stationary object.
7:41pm I have now managed to vault over the stationary object.
7:45pm I am going to run at it again and try not to fall over.
7:46pm I did not fall over.
7:50pm Trampoline time!
7:55pm This girl is doing back full and a half twists onto a mat and I can barely do a back flip into a foam pit.
