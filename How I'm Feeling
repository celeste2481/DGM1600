11:07am I'm tired 
11:09am Now I understand what to do
2:30pm I am conflicted
4:30pm I have to go to work and teach piano
4:45pm why does this kid have to cry every time something doesn't go his way?
5:00pm I really don't like kids. Why do I work with them?
5:10pm This kid has legit been on this song for two months. Why don't his parents make him practice?
