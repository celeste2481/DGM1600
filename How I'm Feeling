11:07am I'm tired 
11:09am Now I understand what to do
2:30pm I am conflicted
4:30pm I have to go to work and teach piano
4:45pm why does this kid have to cry every time something doesn't go his way?
5:00pm I really don't like kids. Why do I work with them?
5:10pm This kid has legit been on this song for two months. Why don't his parents make him practice?
5:30pm The kids are finally going home so I'm smiling and waving like I care.
6:00pm Yay I'm done with work for the day!
6:10pm Gotta go to Sephora because makeup is lyfe
6:13pm I met a cute baby at Sephora with brown skin and blue eyes.
6:15pm I want to marry a black man so I can have beautiful babies too.
6:30pm This lady just gave me a sample of perfume that smells like Caesar's Palace in Vegas.
6:45pm I'm sitting in a parking lot and hoping no one will walk by as I change my clothes. #itscold
